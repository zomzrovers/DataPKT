# Predictive Analytics and Data Pipeline for Drone Aviation Systems

This project focuses on building scalable data infrastructure and predictive models to enhance operational efficiency and maintenance for drone aviation systems. It combines real-time data engineering and machine learning to analyze telemetry and sensor data at scale.

## Objective

Build predictive analytics pipelines and ML models to reduce system downtime, improve maintenance workflows, and enable real-time insights from drone telemetry.

## Approach

- Developed robust **Python-SQL pipelines** to process over **10 million** telemetry and sensor records from drone systems.
- Engineered domain-specific features and built **interpretable ML models** using **clustering** and **regression techniques** to forecast component-level failures across **5+ critical subsystems**.
- Implemented logging, monitoring, and error-handling for reliable pipeline execution in real-time environments.

## Results

- Reduced operational **downtime by 30%** and **accelerated analytics by 25%** via automated forecasting and diagnostics.
- Achieved **95.20% prediction accuracy** with high interpretability by incorporating domain knowledge into model design and tuning.

## Tech Stack

- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL)
- Jupyter Notebooks, Matplotlib
- Git for version control
